All requests to the Nearbyy API must be authenticated using an API key. You can get your API key from the [Nearbyy Dashboard](https://nearbyy.com/dashboard).

The API key must be sent in the `Authorization` header of the request. The header should look like this:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```
